<h1><center>Stereotypes to Stereotypes</center></h1>
<h4>Stereotypes in Printing</h4>
<p>In the heyday of the dime novel, mass printing, fast distribution, and efficient reprinting led publishers to favor the use of stereotype, or duplicate plate, printing. Stereotype printing required less effort then earlier and lowered costs in the case for publishers.</p>

<h4>Stereotypes in Representation</h4>
<p>By the mid-1930s, the word stereotype was being used to refer to oversimplified, generalized representations of people in media. The representations of people of color in dime novels and other popular literature affected the representations of members of those communities in other forms of burgeoning media of the time.</p>
