**Westerns and Frontier Adventures**
Westerns and frontier adventures were extremely popular and laid the foundational template for the same genre today.

Fictionalized stories of Buffalo Bill, Calamity Jane, and Jesse James were sold alongside stories of original characters like Seth Jones to delight audience with adventures in the American West.



**Mystery and Detective Stories**
As urban areas became more developed, detective stories rose to popularity over frontier and western stories. Stories featuring female detectives that appeared from the time demonstrated strong heroines who could take care of themselves.



**Romances**
Romances were some of the most popular stories of the dime novel era, a trend that continues in genre fiction today. Love stories were frequently entwined with other genres, taking place alongside the dashing hero’s adventure or the voyage to an exotic new land.

Heroines of this genre rarely featured in series, since marriage and happily ever after was the goal of these stories.



**Science Fiction**
Science fiction stories in dime novels featured extraordinary inventions, especially airships, that the heroes used to go on their adventures to hidden and faraway places.



**Seafaring Adventures**
As with other adventure stories, tales of treasure, shipwrecks, deserted islands, pirates, and travel to distant lands captivated readers of all ages.

Most sea stories were published in anthologies rather than standard publication series.


**Sports Stories**
As with other dime novels, sports stories followed a formulaic pattern. The typical plot of sports stories featured the protagonist winning “the game for the home team in spite of the odds against him” (Bold, 2011).
